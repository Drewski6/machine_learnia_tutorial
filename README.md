# README

- This project is a follow along for the tutorial series found here:
	- {{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO_fdPEVlfKqMDNmCFzQISI2H_nJcEDJq}}
- The first 9 videos were about python itself.
- I started following along after video 10 where we started with NumPY.
- Many of the notes I add here will be in the Jupyter notebook. It's fairly easy to make notes here and show a lesson.
